Dear colleagues

RADIS is the result of well over a hundred hours of development work, most of which took place
<mark>in my spare time. I developed it with the intention to simplify our work regarding the processing
of radiological images, so that we can focus again on the actual scientific activity.
Vice versa I ask you to consider me on publications for which RADIS was used.
